AxxionKat
===========

To get started with Axxion manifest, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the AxxionKat trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/AxxionKat/android.git -b cm-11.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

To build just:
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch
time make -j# otapackage (replace # with 4 if you have a quad core or with 3 if you have dual)
Please see the [CyanogenMod Wiki](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/) for building instructions.
